# How to use context menus?
Context menus are the latest feature of integrating applications directly into your communities. By simple <kbd>Right-Click</kbd>, you can choose an action for either message, or user.

> Currently there are two places where you can use context menus: on message, and on user.

# List of context menu actions
The complete and auto-updated list of context menus can be found [here](https://kifopl.github.io/kifo-clanker/commandList#todo-fix-this-link).

## Using context menus on `PC`

### Message context menus:
Either <kbd>Right-Click</kbd> on the message or <kbd>Left-Click</kbd> on the <kbd>...</kbd> in the top right corner to open Discord context menu. Then go to `Apps` tab, where you'll find all all possible interactions with the message provided by `Kifo Clanker`. Simply click on the desired action.

### User context menus:
<kbd>Right-Click</kbd> on the user to open Discord context menu. Then go to `Apps` tab, where you'll find all possible interactions with the user provided by `Kifo Clanker`. Simply click on the desired action.
