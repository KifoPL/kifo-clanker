# How to use `/` commands?
Slash Commands are the new, exciting way to interact with bots on Discord. With Slash Commands, all you have to do is type `/` and you're ready to use your favorite bot.<br/>
You can learn everything the bot does and easily find new features as they're added. Validation, error states, and helpful UI walks you through the commands, meaning you can get it right the first time, especially on mobile. You now have one more ally in the fight against your phone's autocorrect (`kifo help`, `! kif hello`, `!kifo hell`, `@KifoPL#3358 HELP BOT BROKE`).

Thanks to the features above, **there is no need for `/help` command** - simply type `/` and click `Kifo Clanker` icon to see all available commands! Each command and command argument has a description below its name.
> Since some commands have an advanced / confusing usage, I created `/guide` command, which links you different guides for very detailed help.

## List of `/` commands
The complete and auto-updated list of command can be found [here](https://kifopl.github.io/kifo-clanker/commandList#list-of-slash-commands-used-with-)

## Using `/` commands on `PC`
After typing `/`, you will see a menu with available command list, as well as a list of bots on the left (represented by their icons). Some bots may have the the same command name, so pay attention to the icons.<br/>
After clicking the chosen command (or pressing `Tab`), if required, type or choose the argument **(you can't skip required arguments)**. To proceed to the next argument, press `Tab`. Optional arguments are listed after `Optional` text.<br/>
When you finish typing in all arguments, press `Enter` and observe magic!

## Using `/` commands on `Mobile`
There are but a few minor differences compared to `PC`. After typing `/`, list of bots is at the bottom of command list.<br/>
To choose a specific command, tap on it. To type or choose an argument, simply tap on it **(you can't skip required arguments)**.<br/>
When all of the required arguments are chosen, send the command like any other message. Simple enough, isn't it?



## Command arguments
There are a few types of arguments a command may require. The most basic is:
- `INTEGER`: Some integer number (`0`, `25`, `69`, `12345`).
- `STRING`: Some text (Discord markdown supported (with emotes!), like `**Hello there**, this is *ya boi Kifo*. :LMAOROFLFUCC:`).
> Some commands that require a specific text have a list of choices (either a string or an integer).
- `BOOLEAN`: `True` or `False`.
- `USER`: Discord user (when using this argument Discord displays a list of users who can see the channel you're in, kinda like when trying to mention them in the message).
- `ROLE`: Same as user, but for roles.
- `CHANNEL`: Any channel (category, voice, stage, etc), also with an interactive list.
- `MENTIONABLE`: User or role.
