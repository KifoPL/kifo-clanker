## What is a `/ticket`?

`/ticket` is a natural way to handle all questions and problems members of huge servers may have. Think of it as an entire forum within a single text channel.

It is sometimes hard to find a question within rules or even find a relevant channel, and that's when this command comes in - it's a neat and organized way to ask questions and receive answers.

## How to use `tickets`?

1. If you have a question or a problem that needs solving, type `/ticket` to create a ticket.
2. Then, in `title`, ask the question, or state the problem.
3. If you need to provide additional details, that's what `description` is for!

#### Friendly tips: *(not required, but they help to get the answer you're looking for!)*

- **Try to find an answer yourself** *(90% of the questions have their answer somewhere in the rules or other generally accessible channels)*.
- **Keep your `titles` brief** *(the perfect title is straight to the point - people love answering simple questions, so try to make it look simple)*.
- **Skip all unnecessary details** *(people often find it disappointing when a giant wall of the text leads to small and easy questions)*.
- **Describe the origin of your problem/question** *(What topic/category brought you to this channel? Where did you expect to find an answer?)*.

And the most important one: __**Don't forget to thank the person for answering!**__ They didn't have to, yet they *chose* to help you. Share kindness everywhere you can.

## Why not a normal channel?

It may seem like an over-complication for you. But think bigger: imagine 20 people trying to ask a question at the same time. Then, 20 other people try to answer. See the problem yet? `/ticket` creates sound-proof booths for every person, where they all can ask questions, and they will be able to hear the answers.
