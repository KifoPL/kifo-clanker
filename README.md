# Kifo Clankerâ„¢ - When general purpose bots fail, run !kifo
## Super slow-mode, auto reactions, detailed stats and more!

Kifo Clanker is a Discord Bot that helps you manage top posts in channels, auto reactions, super slow-mode (Up to 1 year!), and many more.

> This bot doesn't feature general commands, like mute, ban, etc. - it's not a general purpose bot, it's *special forces* bot. 

This bot is in continuous development, so some features may be missing, not working, etc...
